<p>Hello, there. My name is John.</p>

<p>I have worked as an online publisher for several years and am looking to parlay that experience into a career in web development. I've always had an entreprenurial spirit and intend on taking full advantage of my newfound skills.

<!-- I put the script here on purpose so only part of the page would load. If I put the script on the bottom of the page, it would reveal some of the answers, and that's cheating!-->
<!--For some reason, placing the script tag here works like a charm sometimes and other times it doesnt even though i made no changes. Odd.-->
