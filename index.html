<h1>About Me</h1>

</header>

<p>Hello, there. My name is John. I'm from Dallas, Texas. I was in the Navy for four years and graduated from The University of Texas-Austin.</p>
<p>I have worked as an online publisher for several years and am looking to parlay that experience into a career in web development. I've always had an entreprenurial spirit and intend on taking full advantage of my newfound skills.</p>
