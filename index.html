<br /> 
<p>Hello, there. My name is John.</p>
<br /> 
<hr />
<p>I have worked as an online publisher for several years and am looking to parlay that experience into a career in web development. I've always had an entreprenurial spirit and intend on taking full advantage of my newfound skills.

<!--For some reason, placing the script tag here works like a charm sometimes and other times it doesnt even though i made no changes. Odd.-->

<p>I'm from Dallas, Texas. I was in the Navy for four years and graduated from The University of Texas-Austin.</p>

<p>As you might have guessed from my 'guessing game', I like avocados, poker, and coding in Javascript on my Mac.</p>
