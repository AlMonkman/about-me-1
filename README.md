# About Me, with a guessing game

This is a guessing game where users will be prompted with five yes or no questions. The questions were designed to give the user a better idea of the author's interests/hobbies.

The goal of the project was to write a very basic website made mostly of Javascript conditional statements with some added HTML/CSS as a bonus.

## Questions about this project

<br>

### **How did it go, overall?**
<br>
Overall, I already knew what needed to be done logic wise on the Javascript end. That said, I still ended up spending quite a bit of time debugging when I forgot to include a variable again after using a logical operator in the same 'if statement.' 

Here's what I put:

`if (askTexas.toLowerCase() === 'yes' || 'y')`

Here's how it should look: 

`if (askTexas.toLowerCase() === 'yes' || askTexas.toLowerCase() === 'y')`

To the naked eye, my code looks more efficient and should work. WRONG.

### **How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?**
<br>
I spent probably 45 minutes to an hour debugging that one line. Writing the rest of the Javascript code took maybe 20 minutes. I didn't do it all in one sitting or try and rush through it. I spent a lot more time going over the assignment's requirements and it definitely took longer than I thought. Just writing and formatting a simple READ ME file takes time if you do it right.

## New features added:

The project has been updated to include a number guessing game along with a game trying to guess my favorite movies. 

To accomplish this, work had to be done involving storing data with arrays, as well as using different FOR and WHILE LOOPS to rerun several lines of code efficiently.
